  				<p class="left">The full context of John Muir's famous quote above elucidates what he considered his life's work: his tireless efforts to study the wilderness and preserve it for future generations. To John Muir, the wilderness was not simply a playground or vacation, it was home. Although he wrote extensively about the mountains of California, describing all the natural features and relationships between them with a fervor both spiritual and scientific, he believed "One day's exposure to mountains is better than a cartload of books."
  				<br><br>
  				Muir had been a nature lover since childhood, and studied botany and geology in college, but it was an industrial accident in 1867 that set him on the path to living full-time in the wilderness. Having nearly lost his eyesight, he commented that "God has to nearly kill us sometimes, to teach us lessons." He then dedicated his life to wild wanderings and the study of botany, to see all the beautiful vistas of the American landscape that his injury had nearly denied him.

  				Over the next few decades, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir">John Muir</a> would become a well-known and influential nature writer, publishing hundreds of articles and 12 books. He was respected as both a naturalist and a quintessential American free spirit, writing poetically about the spiritual experience of wild nature, how absolutely necessary it is to our humanity. He inspired countless Americans to leave their houses and find their sense of place instead in something broader and more eternal, among the dramatic rock faces of canyons and the ancient trees of western forests.
  				<br><br>
  				Recognizing the need to protect these landscapes from destruction, in 1890 he successfully lobbied the US Congress to preserve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park">Yosemite Valley</a> as a National Park. This halted timber harvest and sheep grazing, which he observed as being harmful to the delicate ecosystem. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt came to Yosemite, and asked John Muir to show him "the Real Yosemite". Roosevelt was so moved by the experience that he placed the park under greater Federal protection, created four more such National Parks and created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Forest_Service">Forest Service</a>.
  				<br><br>
  				In 1892 John Muir founded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Club">Sierra Club</a>, an alpine club which throughout its history has fought for the establishment and preservation of natural areas. This club was highly influential in pulling the ears of the US government to establish a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service">National Park system</a> in the early 20th century. Muir's legacy lives on in this club.
