	<h2>Title of new blog post</h2>

	<p class="first">You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>

	<p>Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. At home you have unlimited time. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?</p>

	<p>This piece of canvas is your world. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Use what you see, don't plan it. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Happy painting, God bless.</p>

	<h2>Technically, this is the first post</h2>

	<p class="first">I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. You are only limited by your imagination. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it.</p>

	<p>I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. We need dark in order to show light. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.</p>

	<p>A little happy sunlight shining through there. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. It's important to me that you're happy. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast?</p>
